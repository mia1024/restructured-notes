# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [ dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ dev ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
